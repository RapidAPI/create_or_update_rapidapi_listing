[x] cleanup index.js
[ ] more tests
[ ] better error handling
[ ] re-introduce x-rapidapi-identity-key in a more sane way (tbd)
[ ] more tests :)
[ ] use ownerid and api name for finding the "original" api
[ ] option to set new version as current
[ ] option to always update the latest, already existing version
[ ] option to pass apiId and use that instead of searching for it
[ ] option to rename the existing version if we update that (instead of creating a new one) -> probably cannot be done
[ ] pass existing apiVersionId to work on as well as apiId
[ ] rename graphql env vars now we now longer using the rest papi
